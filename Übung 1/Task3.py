We wanted to analyze the dataset, to see if theres a correlation between benefits with respect to unemployment.

'''
Negative Correlation between demand and total unemployment: the change in demand is the target variable influencing the change in unemployment. Specifically, a decrease in demand is associated with an increase in unemployment.

#8
'''
There is an existing correlation between the number of the amount of benefits with respect to the unemployment rate.
However: Due to differences between young and old age, the ratio of female and male workforce and the great depression following the War, the use correlation coefficient as a standalone measurement may not be suitable.
