'''
refers to pixels in a visualization that represents data; contributes to the communication of information. 
concept is associated with the idea that unnecessary/redundant ink in a visualization can distract the viewer; hinders clear interpretation of data

Example circuit design: 
engineers aim to convey complex information about connections for electronic circuits with e.g. diagrams;
unnecessary lines, labels, or visual elements can lead to confusion for other engineers
minimizing data ink ensures that each visual element serves a specific purpose in conveying information;
 Clear and concise visualizations help engineers analyze/troubleshoot;
make informed decisions about the circuit's design and functionality
