'''
Grayscale/Single Color Palette:
Convert graph to grayscale; use a single color palette that ranges from light to dark shades;
simplifies the visual representation and still conveys the relative proportions;

Grouping by Color Intensity:
Group the ML techniques into categories -> assign shades of a single color to each category;
e.g: shades of blue for one group, shades of green for another

Contrasting Edge Colors:
Keep majority of the area graph in a neutral color, usecontrasting edge colors or borders for each ML technique;
helps to distinguish between the areas without introducing too many colors

Pattern Fills:
Use patterns or textures instead of distinct colors;
Assign different patterns to each ML technique; maintain a grayscale or monotone color scheme;
makes it easier to differentiate between areas.

Color Saturation Gradient:
Use single color and represent the 12 ML techniques using different levels of color saturation;
Lighter shades indicate lower percentages, darker shades higher percentages.

Annotations:
Assign unique symbol or pattern to ML technique -> fewer colors
